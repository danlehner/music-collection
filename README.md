AlbumHub

While learning how to build a full stack web application from the ground up, two music software engineers were looking for a way to catalog their album collection and AlbumHub was born. Log your albums and view your whole collection, keep notes on each, or see all that you have by an individual artist. In a world of infinite choice of streaming music, keep track of your favorites all in one place.
